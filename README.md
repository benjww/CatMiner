# CatMiner
Distributed as part of the publication "Use of Large Language Models for Extracting and Analyzing Data from Heterogeneous Catalysis Literature" by Benjamin W. Walls and Suljo Linic.

For the code pertaining to downloading and preprocessing research articles, see our associated [text_mining_prep repository](https://github.com/benjww/text_mining_prep/). We executed this code entirely in Python 3.12.5 in macOS. In the future we intend to formalize the range of supported Python versions and operating systems. 

Please install required packages by running "pip install requirements.txt" before you begin.
