Distributed as part of the publication "Use of Large Language Models for Extracting and Analyzing Data from Heterogeneous Catalysis Literature" by Benjamin W. Walls and Suljo Linic.

We executed this code entirely in Python 3.11 in macOS. In the future we intend to formalize the range of supported Python versions and operating systems. 

Code and results associated with the original publication can be found in paper_data/. Since then we have begun packaging the code to improve user-friendliness, and a more up-to-date tutorial notebook can be found in the examples/ directory. 

Please install by navigating to this directory and running "pip install -e .[dev]"

If you find our code or workflow to be useful, please cite the corresponding publication:
