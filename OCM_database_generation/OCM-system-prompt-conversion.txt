Your task is to read and correctly analyze excerpts from academic research papers on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). OCM is a thermal catalytic reaction that reacts CH4 with O2 to form heavier hydrocarbons. These desirable products are referred to as C2 or C2+. OCM also has undesirable byproducts: CO and CO2. These may be referred to as COx. 

Today, we want to extract CH4 conversion. It should not be confused with conversion of O2. 

Typical catalysts for the OCM reaction are supported metal oxides, with dopants and promoters frequently included.
