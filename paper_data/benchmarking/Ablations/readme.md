The values reported in Tables 1 and 2 in our paper are obtained by scoring the outputs of main.py in each of these subdirectories. Before running each main.py file, you must:

1. Populate the corresponding api.env file with the necessary information, including a valid API key, as described below.
2. Copy the 40 preprocessed text files that make up the test set into the corresponding /test-set/ directory. These files can be obtained by running the scripts and following the instructions included in the [/download_papers/test_set/](https://github.com/benjww/text_mining_prep/tree/main/download_papers/test_set/) and [/preprocessing/test_set/](https://github.com/benjww/text_mining_prep/tree/main/preprocessing/) directories in our sibling [text_mining_prep repository](https://github.com/benjww/text_mining_prep/tree/main/).

Llama 3.1 405B is employed across all four of these ablation tests. It is called using the Amazon Bedrock service provided by Amazon Web Services. Documentation for this cloud service can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). In the provided api.env files you must enter your desired model ID, AWS Region, and two confidential API keys that can be requested upon creation of an AWS account. Model IDs and supported AWS Regions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html).
