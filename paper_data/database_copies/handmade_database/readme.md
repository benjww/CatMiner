The default handmade-database.xlsx is the "rubric" used for grading in "Text mining performance" section.

The modified version handmade-database-resolved.xlsx is the same but with all catalyst abbreviations manually replaced with fully written-out names as described in the "Abbreviation resolution" section.

The modified version handmade-database-normalized.xlsx is the same but with all entities manually normalized as described in the "Entity normalization" section. 

Note that the "Proximity" columns denote how far away the catalyst name and operating temperature, respectively, are from their associated property value in the source text. For example, the value "3B" in cell E15 indicates that we located the catalyst name "LaPrO3+x@5Li2CO3" 3 sentences *prior* to the associated property value, 30.6% yield. While the letter B denotes # of sentences prior, F denotes number of sentences *after*.
