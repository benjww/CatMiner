Your task is to read and correctly analyze excerpts from academic research papers on the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). OCM is a thermal catalytic reaction that reacts CH4 with O2 to form heavier hydrocarbons. These desirable products are referred to as C2 or C2+. OCM also has undesirable byproducts: CO and CO2. These may be referred to as COx. 

Today, we want to extract C2(+) yield. The phases "OCM yield", "C2 yield", "C2(+) yield", and "C2+ yield" may be used interchangeably, but should not be confused with conversion or selectivity. They should also not be confused with yield of a particular chemical. E.g., C2H4 yield =/= C2(+) yield. 

Typical catalysts for the OCM reaction are supported metal oxides, with dopants and promoters frequently included.
