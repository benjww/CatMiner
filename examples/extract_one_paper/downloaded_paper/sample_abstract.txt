Low-temperature catalytic oxidative coupling of methane in an electric field over a Ce–W–O catalyst system
We examined oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over various Ce–W–O catalysts at 423 K in an electric field.
Ce2(WO4)3/CeO2 catalyst showed high OCM activity.
In a periodic operation test over Ce2(WO4)3/CeO2 catalyst, C2 selectivity exceeded 60% during three redox cycles.
However, Ce2(WO4)3/CeO2 catalyst without the electric field showed low activity, even at 1073 K: CH4 Conv., 6.0%; C2 Sel., 2.1%.
A synergetic effect between the Ce2(WO4)3 structure and electric field created the reactive oxygen species for selective oxidation of methane.
Results of XAFS, in-situ Raman and periodic operation tests demonstrated that OCM occurred as the lattice oxygen in Ce2(WO4)3 (short W–O bonds in distorted WO4 unit) was consumed.
The consumed oxygen was reproduced by a redox mechanism in the electric field.
